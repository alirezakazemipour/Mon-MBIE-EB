### Things to do

1. Apply changes:
    1. observation vs visitation bonus
    2. no bonus for minimum reward
    3. KLUCB over the monitor
    4. Per goal termination in exploration
2. Experiments with known monitors
3. Proofs
    1. Does MBIE(explore) visit every (observable?) state-action pairs.
    2. Does the MBIE(exploit) finds the optimal/cautious policy with there is some parts that don't have optimisim on
       them?
